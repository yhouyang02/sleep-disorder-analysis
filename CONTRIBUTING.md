# Contributing

This outlines how to propose a change to our project, adjusted from the [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) contributing guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal [reprex](https://tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

The guide of set up a development environment is listed in the [README.md](https://github.com/yhouyang02/DSCI_522_project-group01/blob/main/README.md) file.

## Pull requests

* We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
* New code should follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide.
* Environment update should be made when new dependencies are added. Please use `conda-lock` to update the `environment.yml` and `environment.lock.yml` files.
