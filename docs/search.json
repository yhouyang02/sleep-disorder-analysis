    "text": "Stress has become a critical public health concern, yet its relationship with daily habits remains complex to quantify. In this project, we explore how an individual’s sleep wellness relates to their reported stress level using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. Our goal is to investigate whether sleep patterns can help explain or predict how stressed a person feels. To do this, we perform exploratory data analysis to understand trends in the data and build a predictive model to evaluate how well sleep duration and related lifestyle variables can estimate a person’s stress level. Our analysis reveals a significant inverse relationship between sleep metrics and stress. Specifically, our model achieved an \\(R^2\\) score of \\(0.51\\), corroborating that shorter sleep duration and lower quality are associated with higher self-reported stress. However, residual analysis suggests non-linear relationships that a linear model may not fully capture. These findings highlight the potential of using simple lifestyle metrics for stress assessment, while also indicating the need for more complex modeling techniques to account for the nuanced nature of sleep health."

In our analysis, we evaluate the relationships between stress level and three features about sleep wellness. The first feature is Sleep Duration, a numerical/continuous variable representing hours of sleep per night. The second is Quality of Sleep, a numerical/ordinal measure of self-reported quality of sleep. The third is Sleep Disorder, a categorical variable indicating diagnosed sleep disorder (None, Insomnia, or Sleep Apnea). The target column Stress Level is the level of stress assessed through interviews or questionnaires. The values range from \\(3\\) (minimum) to \\(8\\) (maximum).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Exploratory data analysis of sleep features and stress levels\n\n\n\nThere’s a strong negative correlation (\\(r = -0.829\\), \\(p = 7.188e-77\\)), indicating that longer sleep duration is significantly associated with lower stress levels. This relationship is highly statistically significant.\nAn even stronger negative correlation exists (\\(r = -0.904\\), \\(p = 1.534e-111\\)), suggesting that better sleep quality has a more pronounced relationship with reduced stress than sleep duration alone. The extremely low p-value confirms this is not due to chance.\nThe violin plots reveal that individuals with no sleep disorder cluster at higher stress levels (centered around 5-6), while those with sleep apnea and insomnia show broader distributions with generally elevated stress. Insomnia cases appear to have slightly higher median stress levels than sleep apnea.\nThe bimodal density plot suggests two distinct subpopulations in the dataset - one centered around stress level 4 and another around stress level 7-8. This could indicate fundamentally different groups, possibly corresponding to those with and without sleep-related issues.\nThe data strongly supports that both sleep quantity and quality are inversely related to stress, with sleep quality being the stronger predictor of stress levels. Given the clear linear trends observed in the data, implementing a linear regression model such as Ridge would be an optimal approach to quantify how well these sleep-related features can explain variations in stress levels."

Assumptions and Limitations\nTo predict stress levels from our features, we employed Ridge regression, which implicitly assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the target variable. This linearity assumption represents a key limitation, as real-world relationships between sleep parameters, lifestyle factors, and perceived stress are often non-linear (as suggested by some of our EDA scatter plots). Additionally, we did not incorporate polynomial or interaction terms, further restricting the model’s ability to capture more complex patterns. Another important limitation arises from the presence of outliers observed in the exploratory data analysis. Because mean squared error (MSE) is highly sensitive to outliers and is reported on a squared scale (making interpretation less intuitive), it may not have been the most robust evaluation metric. Similarly, \\(R^2\\) assumes linearity and can be misleading when the true relationship is non-linear."

Future studies could explore this bidirectional relationship further."

Additionally, incorporating more comprehensive lifestyle, psychological, and physiological variables (e.g., actigraphy data, cortisol measurements, or validated anxiety/depression scales) could substantially enhance the predictive power of stress-assessment models. Exploring non-linear modeling techniques (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks) and polynomial/interaction terms would better capture the complex relationships evident in the data. Finally, adopting more robust and interpretable evaluation metrics—such as mean absolute error (MAE), Huber loss, or median absolute error—would reduce the influence of outliers and provide clearer insights into model performance."
