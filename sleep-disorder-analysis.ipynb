    "## 1. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explore how an individual’s sleep wellness relates to their reported stress level using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. Our goal is to investigate whether sleep patterns can help explain or predict how stressed a person feels. To do this, we perform exploratory data analysis to understand trends in the data and examine whether shorter or irregular sleep is associated with higher stress. We then build a predictive model to evaluate how well sleep duration and related lifestyle variables can estimate a person’s stress level. This analysis aims to provide insight into the connection between sleep habits and stress, and to identify whether simple, easily measurable lifestyle information can meaningfully contribute to stress assessment."

    "## 2. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Stress is a major public health concern, there are surveys consistently report that more than 1/3 of adults experience high stress on a regular basis (Sleep Foundation, 2025). Chronic stress has been linked to anxiety, cardiovascular disease, weakened immunity, and reduced productivity. At the same time, insufficient sleep is extremely common—recent population studies suggest that about 30 % of adults sleep fewer than the recommended 7 hours per night (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2024). Because sleep plays a crucial role in emotional regulation, cognitive performance, and physical recovery, disruptions in sleep duration are believed to contribute directly to increased stress levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we ask whether information about a person’s sleep duration and daily lifestyle habits can help explain or predict their self-reported stress level. This question is important because stress assessments typically rely on subjective questionnaires or clinical evaluations, which can vary among individuals and are difficult to scale. If simple, easy-to-measure variables—such as how long someone sleeps or how active they are during the day—can provide meaningful insight into stress, this could support early identification of at-risk individuals and inform recommendations for healthier sleep and lifestyle patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this question, we analyze the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset (Varishabatool, n.d.), which contains information on individuals’ sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity, demographic attributes, and self-reported stress. This dataset allows us to examine behavioral patterns related to sleep, identify lifestyle factors that correlate with stress, and evaluate whether a predictive model can estimate stress levels using accessible and non-clinical lifestyle data."
